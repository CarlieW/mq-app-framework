<h1>About FlowTow!</h1>

    <p>FlowTow is a new, exciting, photo sharing service like nothing you've seen before!
    </p>

    <p>All current students in COMP249 at Macquarie University have been added as users
    in this version of FlowTow.  Your username is the first part of your student email
     address (before the @ sign) and your student ID is your password.</p>

    <p>The avatars used on this site are generated based on your user name using the
    excellent <a href="http://robohash.org/">Robohash</a> service.  Robohash generates
    a random robot based on any input string.</p>

    <p>Feel free to use this site as you wish for the duration of the unit. Please do
    not post offensive content.</p>
